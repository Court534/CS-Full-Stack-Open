# CS-Full-Stack-Open

This repo will be were I store my code for the challenges of the FullStackOpen course found [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous integration.

Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.
